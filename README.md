# Who Pays App

This is a multi-platform application developed by Harrison using React Native with Expo Snack.

This app aims to streamline calculations and minimize the number of payments required when sharing expenses and group bills with your family and friends. All you need to do is record who paid the bill, the amount, and the people involved. The app will automatically calculates the balance for everyone and provides a final result indicating who need to pay whom. It reduces the number of payments you need to make by consolidating all existing transactions and performing the necessary calculations. (Please be aware that there may be a slight discrepancy of a few cents between the total expenses and the total repayment amount due to certain expenses that cannot be evenly divided.)
